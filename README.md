# PHP-Multiple-Image-Uploader
Simple multiple image uploader with delete and image compression feature

I am demonstrating a simple PHP program that I've made to upload multiple images at same time, plus examining each image being uploaded, is it too large or is okay, if some images are too big then it will compress/resize the image to be stored on the server.

This program also list all the uploaded files so we can see it on the browser screen with a delete link/button below each image to remove it from server.
